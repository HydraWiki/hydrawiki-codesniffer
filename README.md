[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/HydraWiki/hydrawiki-codesniffer.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/HydraWiki/hydrawiki-codesniffer)

Abstract
--------
This project implements a set of rules for use with [PHP CodeSniffer][0].

HydraWiki is based on MediaWiki's Coding Standards, it applies additional coding standards on top of the [MediaWiki Standard][3].

See [MediaWiki conventions][1] from MediaWiki for a detailed description of the
coding conventions that are validated by these rules. :-)

How to install
--------------
1. Create a composer.json which adds this project as a dependency:

    ```
    {
    	"require-dev": {
    		"hydrawiki/hydrawiki-codesniffer": "1.0.9"
    	},
    	"scripts": {
    		"test": [
    			"phpcs -p -s"
    		],
    		"fix": "phpcbf"
    	}
    }
    ```
2. Create a .phpcs.xml with our configuration:

    ```
    <?xml version="1.0"?>
    <ruleset>
    	<rule ref="./vendor/hydrawiki/hydrawiki-codesniffer/HydraWiki"/>
    	<file>.</file>
    	<arg name="extensions" value="php,php5,inc"/>
    	<arg name="encoding" value="UTF-8"/>
    </ruleset>
    ```
3. Install: `composer update`
4. Run: `composer test`
5. Run: `composer fix` to auto-fix some of the errors, others might need
   manual intervention.
6. Commit!

Note that for most MediaWiki projects, MediaWiki also recommend to add a PHP linter
to your `composer.json` â€“ see the [full documentation][2] for more details.

## Acknowledgements
